Developer Guide
==============================================================================
This Developer Guide is essential reading for maintainers and contributors to understand how the ``mcp_ohmy_sql`` codebase is structured, designed, and maintained. The guide follows a systematic approach, starting with foundational components and building up to show how everything integrates into a complete MCP server. Each section covers a specific architectural component with detailed explanations, while the final integration guide ties everything together to help you understand where to make changes, add features, or fix bugs effectively.
