ðŸš€ Major update: AWS Redshift support

Introducing [mcp_ohmy_sql v0.1.3](https://github.com/MacHu-GWU/mcp_ohmy_sql-project/) - now with production-ready AWS Redshift integration and a completely refactored architecture.

ðŸŽ¯ What's new in 0.1.3:

- âœ… **AWS Redshift**: Complete integration with Redshift Serverless and provisioned clusters via boto3
- âœ… **Smart Error Handling**: Actionable troubleshooting guidance for connection, schema, and query failures  
- âœ… **Enterprise Architecture**: Modular adapter-based design with clean separation between config, database ops, and MCP tools
- âœ… **Production Testing**: Real database testing infrastructure with SQLite, PostgreSQL, and AWS Redshift instances

ðŸ”¥ Why this matters:

Now you can seamlessly query both your operational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL) AND your data warehouses (Redshift) through a single MCP server. The new architecture makes the codebase more maintainable and extensible for future database integrations.

The enhanced error messaging means less debugging time and more productive AI conversations - no more cryptic database errors!

Coming next: MongoDB, ElasticSearch, and AWS Glue Catalog support.
