# mcp_ohmy_sql Roadmap

This document outlines the planned features and improvements for the mcp_ohmy_sql project. Our goal is to make this the most comprehensive and user-friendly SQL MCP server for AI assistants.

## 🎯 Vision

To create a production-ready MCP server that enables AI assistants to interact with any SQL database safely, efficiently, and intelligently, with enterprise-grade features for deployment, security, and data handling.

## 📅 Roadmap Overview

### Phase 1: Installation & Distribution (Q3 2025)

#### 1. UV Package Manager Support
**Modern Python package installation with UV**

Enable installation via the UV package manager for faster, more reliable Python dependency resolution. UV provides significant performance improvements over traditional pip installations and better handles complex dependency trees. This will allow users to install mcp_ohmy_sql with a simple `uv install mcp-ohmy-sql` command, making the setup process more accessible to Python developers who have adopted this modern tooling.

#### 2. Docker Container Support
**One-command deployment with Docker**

Package mcp_ohmy_sql as a Docker container with pre-configured environments for common database connections. This containerized approach will include optimized base images for different database types, built-in health checks, and docker-compose templates for quick multi-database setups. Users will be able to run `docker run mcp-ohmy-sql` with environment variables for instant deployment, eliminating complex local setup requirements.

### Phase 2: Database Compatibility (Q3 2025)

#### 3. PostgreSQL & MySQL Testing Suite
**Comprehensive test coverage for major SQL databases**

Develop extensive integration test suites specifically for PostgreSQL and MySQL, covering edge cases, data type mappings, and database-specific features. This includes testing for different versions of each database, handling of special data types (arrays, JSON, GIS data), and performance benchmarks. The test suite will ensure reliable operation across the most popular open-source databases and provide confidence for production deployments.

#### 4. AWS Redshift Integration
**Enterprise data warehouse connectivity**

Add native support for AWS Redshift with optimizations for columnar storage and massive parallel processing queries. This integration will include Redshift-specific schema introspection, handling of distribution keys and sort keys in schema encoding, and query optimization hints for better performance. Special attention will be given to managing long-running queries and implementing smart pagination for large result sets common in data warehouse environments.

#### 5. AWS Glue Catalog Integration
**Unified metadata management for data lakes**

Integrate with AWS Glue Data Catalog to enable querying across multiple data sources including S3-based data lakes, Redshift, and RDS databases through a unified interface. This feature will allow AI assistants to understand and query data relationships across an entire data ecosystem, not just individual databases. The implementation will include automatic schema discovery, partition awareness, and cost-optimized query routing.

### Phase 3: Advanced Data Handling (Q4 2025)

#### 6. DuckDB Local Analysis Engine
**High-performance local data processing**

Implement DuckDB as a local analytical engine for processing large query results without overwhelming LLM context windows. When queries return massive datasets, the results will be automatically loaded into an embedded DuckDB instance where AI assistants can perform aggregations, filtering, and analysis operations locally. This approach enables working with gigabyte-scale results while only sending summaries and relevant subsets to the LLM.

#### 7. Result Export & Caching System
**Persistent data export with multiple format support**

Create a comprehensive system for exporting query results to local files in various formats (CSV, Parquet, JSON, Excel) with automatic file naming, compression options, and metadata preservation. The system will include a result cache that tracks exported files, enables re-use of previous query results, and provides data lineage information. This feature will be invaluable for data analysis workflows where results need to be shared or processed by other tools.

### Phase 4: Enterprise Features (Q1 2026)

#### 8. Remote MCP Server Deployment
**Cloud-native deployment with one-click setup**

Develop deployment templates and automation scripts for running mcp_ohmy_sql as a remote MCP server on major cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure). This will include Terraform/CloudFormation templates, Kubernetes manifests, and automated SSL certificate management. The remote deployment will support WebSocket connections, load balancing for high availability, and automatic scaling based on query load.

#### 9. Access Control & Permission System
**Enterprise-grade security with fine-grained permissions**

Implement a comprehensive permission system that allows administrators to control access at multiple levels: database, schema, table, and even column level. The system will support role-based access control (RBAC), integration with enterprise authentication systems (LDAP, OAuth, SAML), audit logging for compliance, and dynamic data masking for sensitive information. Configuration will be managed through a simple YAML format with support for permission inheritance and exceptions.
